# What Changed - Conversion to Embeddable Sidebar Widget

## Summary
This project has been converted from a standalone React app to an embeddable sidebar widget with collapsible navigation and settings menu that can be embedded on any website using a simple `<script>` tag.

## Key Changes

### 1. Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- Changed build mode from `app` to `library` (IIFE format)
- Configured output to generate `cc360-sidebar.js` and `cc360-sidebar.css`
- Set up for single-file distribution

### 2. Entry Point (`src/main.tsx`)
- Removed `App.tsx` dependency
- Uses `Sidebar` component (which includes `SettingsMenu`)
- Added auto-initialization function that runs when the script loads
- Widget automatically creates its own container (`#cc360-sidebar-root`)
- Sidebar is positioned fixed on the left side with proper z-index
- Exports `initSidebar()` function for manual initialization if needed

### 3. Demo Page (`index.html`)
- Converted to a demo/documentation page
- Shows how to use the widget
- Includes usage examples and build instructions

### 4. New Files Created

**example-usage.html**
- Example showing how to embed the widget on a real website
- Demonstrates proper HTML structure with margin-left: 320px for content

**dist/test.html** (generated after build)
- Local test file using the built widget files
- Can be opened directly in a browser to test the widget
- Shows all features of the sidebar

**DEPLOYMENT.md**
- Complete deployment guide
- Covers multiple hosting options (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
- Includes CORS configuration and CDN setup

**CHANGES.md** (this file)
- Documents all changes made to the project

### 5. Updated Documentation (`README.md`)
- Clear instructions for embedding the widget
- Build and deployment instructions
- Project structure documentation

## How It Works

1. **Build Process:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates two files in `dist/`:
   - `cc360-sidebar.js` (730KB, 223KB gzipped) - Contains React, Framer Motion, dependencies, and widget code
   - `cc360-sidebar.css` (15KB, 4KB gzipped) - Contains all Tailwind CSS styles

2. **Auto-Initialization:**
   When the script loads, it:
   - Waits for DOM to be ready
   - Creates a container element with ID `cc360-sidebar-root`
   - Renders the Sidebar component inside with fixed positioning (320px wide, collapsible to 64px)
   - Adds it to the beginning of the document body

3. **Embedding:**
   Users add these lines to their HTML:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://your-domain.com/cc360-sidebar.css">
   <script src="https://your-domain.com/cc360-sidebar.js"></script>
   ```

## What Stayed the Same

- The Sidebar component (`src/components/Sidebar.tsx`) - unchanged
- The SettingsMenu component (`src/components/SettingsMenu.tsx`) - unchanged
- All styles in `src/index.css` - unchanged
- All dependencies - unchanged

## Files Removed

- `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Removed (using Sidebar instead)
- `src/App.tsx` - Not imported anymore (no longer needed)

## Next Steps

1. **Test Locally:**
   - Run `npm run dev` to test in development
   - Run `npm run build` to create production files
   - Open `dist/test.html` in a browser to test the built widget

2. **Deploy:**
   - Follow instructions in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
   - Choose a hosting provider
   - Upload `dist/cc360-navbar.js` and `dist/cc360-navbar.css`

3. **Share:**
   - Provide users with the URL to your deployed files
   - They add the script/link tags to their HTML
   - The navbar appears automatically!

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to components in `src/`
2. Test with `npm run dev`
3. Build with `npm run build`
4. Test the built version by opening `dist/test.html`
5. Deploy updated files to your hosting service

## Customization

To customize the sidebar:
1. Edit `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` for navigation structure
2. Edit `src/components/SettingsMenu.tsx` for settings menu
3. Modify styling or behavior as needed
4. Rebuild with `npm run build`
5. Redeploy the updated files

The widget will automatically include all your changes!
